# python-challenge

This is the homework challenge for PyBank and PyPoll

this homework is create a script to run for each analysis

This homework is going to test our skill in CSV reader to read the file from each homework resources folder and write the output into analysis folder

In PyBank challenges occured in returning the correct value based on homework output shown

In order to understand get the correct value a lot of print coding was used to ensure the correct output is shown

With PyPoll I got ideas from Geeksofgeek website to find the winner

The issue with PyPoll is, my code is longer as I believe there is a shorter approach to produce the output

As the Resources for election_data is big therefore I couldn't upload it to repository
